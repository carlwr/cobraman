# Example

This directory directory contains a simple example application created with the cobra command.

```
cobra init
conra add hello
cobra add goodbye
```

I then added the code in docutil to create a little utility that generates
the documentation for the example application.  This utility uses the CreateDocGenCmdLineTool
and related functions to a create a command-line tool for generating does just for this 
example application.

To generate the sample documentation do:
```
cd example/docutil
go build
./docutil generate-troff
```

Or run *./docutil --help* to see additional options.
